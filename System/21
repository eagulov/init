# List all real users on the VM

cat /etc/passwd | grep '/home' | cut -d: -f1

# Real users on system have a home directory at /home

# or 
# Real users have UIDs starting at 1000, so you can use that fact to filter out # non-reals

cut -d: -f1,3 /etc/passwd | egrep ':[0-9]{4}$' | cut -d: -f1

# This cuts first (username) and third (UID) colon-delimited fields from
# /etc/passwd, then filters for resulting lines which end with colon and four
# digits, then cuts first (username)
