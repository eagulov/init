# Explain how connect yourself as new user. (With graphic session and
# ssh session)

Log in to your server
Log in to your system as the root user:
# ssh root@server_ip_address

Create a new user account
# Use 'adduser' command. Donâ€™t forget to replace username with your desired
# user name:
adduser new_username
# Command will prompt to set and confirm the new user password.

Add user to sudo group
# By default on Debian systems, members of group sudo are granted with sudo
# access. To add user to sudo group use usermod command:
usermod -aG sudo username
# '-a' option tells usermod we are appending and '-G' option tells usermod
# we are appending to group name that follows option

# after use command 'su' to switch user
su new_username

# 'whoami' command tells which user you are currently running
whoami
